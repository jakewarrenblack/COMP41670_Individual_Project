Elements for modelling the board:

Tableau: 

- 7 active stacks of cards.
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 cards in each stack, respectively
- only the top card in each pile is known, the rest are unknown
- when a card is removed from the top, the one below it becomes known

Suit:
- Ace, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10, Queen, King

Foundation piles: 
- 4 piles which begin empty.
- the aim is to fill these 4 piles with suits

Stock pile: 
- The rest of the deck.
- The player can turn over 1-3 cards (depends on rules) to bring into the tableau at any time
